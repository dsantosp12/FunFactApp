# Fun Facts
### From a Treehouse course

This application is an example of the things I am learning at Treehouse.
I learned about IBOutlet and the design pattern for building iOS application (MVC).

This application consist of a button and label that randomly displays a string from
an array every time the button is pressed and change the color of the background.
